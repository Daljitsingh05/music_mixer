Music Mixer

Assignment Description

This project is a simple Music Mixer created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to drag and drop animal images into a dropbox, where they will play their respective sounds. Additionally, when two different animals are placed together, their sounds will play in a mixed sequence.

The project follows basic web development principles and uses drag-and-drop functionality in JavaScript to interact with the elements.

Features

Drag & Drop Mechanism: Users can drag animal images to a designated area.

Audio Playback: Each animal plays a unique sound when dropped.

Sound Mixing: Dropping two animals together plays both sounds sequentially.
